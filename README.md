# StateMachineGenerator
Generates simple state machines for Arduino

Work in progress...

This simple program reads the state machine configuration described in an Yaml file and generates the C code to be used in an Arduino sketch.

I chose this aproach instead of a configurable class because I did not want to include several libraries, I wanted a small footprint and I did not need to have multiple state machines.
